I struggled to add the background image url into the html for a while, but couldn't find a way to do it properly, so I left it in the CSS.

I hesitated putting together all possible parameters, but opted for it, even though it could look a little over the top and counter productive to the excercise at hand in some cases. I always put the common parameter before all specific parameter and wrote each element in the order they appeared in the CSS.

I strived to eliminate as many classes and ids as possible to streamline the html and replaced them by semantic elements.

I didn't originally put detailed comments on the commits, but changed that halfway, and numbered 2 of them the same way (albeit with a different description). I didn't want to use the force push command I found to try to change that as I wasn't sure how that would go.

I forgot to add the readme and the screenshot before commiting, so I had to redo it (hence the 6 and 6b annotation).

I annoted each line in the CSS, although I felt sometimes I didn't have much to annotate with.

I changed the backgrounds' contrast levels as little as I could to optimize the contrast for all situations, to have at least AA rate in all categories and increased line spacing as well as p, ul and h3 elements font sizes to optimize accessibility while keeping as close a size ratio as possible to the original one. 

Toying around with the various elements (and going the wrong way once or twice!) definately has given me a good handle on the various semantic elements and structures we went over in class.
