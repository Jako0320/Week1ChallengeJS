I struggled to add the background image url into the html for a while, but couldn't find a way to do it properly, so I left it in the CSS.

I hesitated putting together all possible parameters, but opted for it, even though it could look a little over the top and counter productive to the excercise at hand in some cases.

I strived to eliminate as many classes and ids as possible to streamline the html and replace them by semantic elements.

Toying around with the various elements (and going the wrong way once or twice!) definately has given me a good handle on the various semantic elements and structures we went over in class.
